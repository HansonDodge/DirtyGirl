Hello internet. I'm super super happy to release a much more refined version of my first public font, Blackout. Sunrise is a lot of fun, and I'm excited to see it pop up all over the place. The emails you've sent over the years continually inspire me. 

As always Blackout is free, but if you wish to support me you can donate on the Blackout page ( http://blackout.sursly.com ) or purchase one of my not-so-free fonts: Guilder ( http://guilder.sursly.com ) or the NEW Lickety Split ( http://licketysplit.sursly.com ). That support is what enables me to create new typefaces, like Ostrich Sans, Knewave, and fun things like refinement on Blackout. 

Thank you, and happy creating,
Tyler
