                                                These trademark usage guidelines (the "Guidelines") are for Dirty Girl® participants wishing to use Dirty Girl trademarks, logos, graphics, etc. on
    clothing, signs, or other personal items (collectively "Dirty Girl Content"). Use of any Dirty Girl Content for commercial purposes without the prior
    written consent or in a manner that violates these Guidelines is expressly prohibited and may constitute trademark infringement and unfair competition in
    violation of federal and state laws. Please respect Dirty Girl's trademarks and have fun.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                To use a Dirty Girl graphic, logo or design (collectively "Dirty Girl Content") pursuant to these guidelines, you must be a registered participant of a
    Dirty Girl event.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Dirty Girl recommends that you use official Dirty Girl Content, which can be downloaded from our website <strong>www.godirtygirl.com</strong>. However, you
    are not required to use official Dirty Girl Content. When using a Dirty Girl trademark, never vary the spelling, add or delete hyphens, make one word two,
    or use a possessive or plural form of the Mark.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                You may not use, or allow any third party to use, any Dirty Girl Content for commercial purposes. This means that you may not sell or offer to sell any
    item that bears any Dirty Girl Content even if you create your own version of such Dirty Girl Content. For example, you may use official Dirty Girl
    Content, or paint or draw your own version of Dirty Girl Content, to create a T-Shirt on Café Press or Zazzle for your own personal use; but, you cannot
    sell that T-Shirt or allow any third party to sell that T-Shirt.
                                            </p>

                                                You agree not to use any Dirty Girl Content in any manner that may be considered disparaging, obscene, vulgar, discriminatory, or otherwise contain any
    hateful, threatening disparaging content. In other words, you cannot use any Dirty Girl trademark in a manner that may harm Dirty Girl's reputation or be
    deemed offensive or harmful to any third party.

                                                You agree not to use any Dirty Girl Content in close proximity to any other third party trademark. For example, if your T-shirt has a Nike® or Adidas®
    trademark or logo, do not place any Dirty Girl Content directly next to such third party trademarks or logos.
                                            </p>

                                                If you use Dirty Girl Content or design your own Dirty Girl content, you acknowledge and agree that you do not acquire any trademark rights to such content
    and that all goodwill resulting from your use of any Dirty Girl Content, or your own version of Dirty Girl content, shall be for the benefit of Dirty Girl.

                                <p>The minimum age to participate is 14 years old. Anyone under the age of 18 will need to have a parent or guardian accompany them to packet pick-up the day of the event. The parent or guardian must sign the waiver online during the registration process for any minor.</p>
                                <p class="bold">Can men participate? </p>
                                <p>No, this one is just for the girls! However, guys are welcome to come as spectators to cheer you on, offer support, or take photos for you or your team. </p>
                                <p class="bold">Why do I need to list medical information?</p>
                                <p>The safety of each participant is of primary concern.  In the unlikely event, a participant is in a situation they are unable to talk, having their medical information on record is vital for a medical team. </p>
                                <p class="bold">Why do I need to special needs or accommodations?</p>
